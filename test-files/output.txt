You are a miner armed with dynamite and stuck in a collapsed mine.
You will move tile by tile until to escape, blowing up rubble and TNT if necessary.
To run the game, you must pass in one or more mode types, as well as a input text file (mine matrix). 
Allowed modes:
verbose (-v) - prints rubble clearings and TNT explosions, and where they take place 
median  (-m) - prints the median rubble cleared at each clearing
stats   (-s) - at the end of the game, prints statistics on first, last, easiest, and hardest tiles cleared.
